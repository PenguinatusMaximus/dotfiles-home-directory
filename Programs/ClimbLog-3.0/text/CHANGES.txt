Changes:
--------

New in 3.0:

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  - new name "ClimbLog" instead of "jClimber's Diary" (too complicated) -
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  - use of JDesktop Layout Manager and Netbeans Mattise designer
    (new library swing-layout-1.0.jar)

  - Group, Route and Search dialogs are resizable on demand and widgets 
    are scale properly (was not before)
  - translation updates
  - use of Windows Look&Feel on Win32 systems (Metal L&F on all other systems)
  - bugfixes:
    - writer for XML data and exported HTML now using UTF-8 encoding
      (wasn't the case on Win32 systems, application data can't be loaded)
    - Group- and RouteDialog now working with clones of the edited items
      (otherwise the object was modified even when user cancels dialog)
    - when tree item (group or route) were changed in dialog then the new name
      will be displayed correctly (was "ABC..." before)
  - refactoring:
    - class DiaryItem moved to data package
    - class DiaryItem only contains common attributes for all diary item types
    - new Route class (subclass of DiaryItem) contains route specfic data
    - route date is now internally stored as Date object, no cryptic
      encoding/decoding anymore
    - all data classes are JavaBeans now (getter/setter, ...)

    => when not available yet it tries to load the data in old format from
       "~/.jcdiary/cldiary" (automatic import)
  - created new Netbeans (5.0) project and Ant build files for ClimbLog, they 
    have much more features then my custome Ant file (JavaDoc, Tests, ...)
